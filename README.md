Twitch Viewer Bot (Python + Proxies)


Simple **twitch viewer bot** that no longer works.


Twitch seems to disregard and no longer count viewers coming from livestream or streamlink.


---

Requires a large amount of proxies (if you want to use public proxies. **Works better with private proxies**) to generate views for specific stream.


### Install with

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
```bash
~\viewerbot>python threads_viewer.py your_channel_name max_nb_of_threads
```

### Example
```bash
~\viewerbot>python threads_viewer.py channel_name 1000
```
